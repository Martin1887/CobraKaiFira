** Intro
   Hey this is my first logseq theme! It's heavily based around the color scheme of my [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Wasp-Obsidian-Theme][Obsidian Theme Wasp]] 

** Dark mode
   This theme was mainly made for Dark Mode.

** Light Mode
   However it does have a nice simple light mode too. It's not as complete as dark mode yet though

** Credits
   Big shout out to [[https://github.com/cannibalox][cannibalox]] for his amazing theme [[https://github.com/cannibalox/logseq-dark-hpx][logseq-dark-hpx]] which I used as a template to create this one with his permission.
